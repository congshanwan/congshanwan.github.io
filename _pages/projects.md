Project 1: Efficiency Optimization and Angular Misalignment Analysis of Interlayer Grating Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics
* A new theory, the “equivalent index slab (EIS)” method, is proposed to extend the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) to rectangular diffraction grating involving surface waves. The new RCWA-EIS method is less numerical sensitivity and more computationally efficient. In this method, the grating layer is replaced by multiple uniform slab waveguides, called the equivalent index slabs, such that the field amplitudes and phases at the cover-grating interface and the grating-waveguide interface remain unchanged. This step circumvents the necessity of constructing a large dimensional matrix and avoids round-off errors during matrix inversion.<br/>

* The proposed RCWA-EIS method can be used to calculate grating coupling efficiency of various grating structures, including binary gratings, sawtooth gratings, parallelogramic gratings, volume gratings, as well as grating with bottom reflectors, etc. The calculations are compared with those obtained from FDTD simulations. <br/>
