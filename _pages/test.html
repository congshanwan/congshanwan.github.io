My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>robotics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. More specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the provably safe collaboration of multiple robots (quadrotors and mobile robots), and safe learning based control techniques for robotics.


R1. Safe Certificate-Based Maneuvers for Teams of Quadrotors
<p> Developed online learning method for highly nonlinear quadrotor dynamics using recursive online Gaussian Process. <br />
Designed safe control certificates for the quadrotor to explore the unknown state space with safety guarantees. <br />
Implemented Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the states of quadrotors with tracking and IMU data.

R3. Safe Swarm Robotic

* Developed safety control certificates to ensure safe aggressive maneuvers of multi-quadrotor and mobile robot swarms
* Implemented safety certificates on teams of quadrotors and robots with Robot Operating System (ROS) (C++, Python).
* Integrated a multi-robot test-bed with multiple quadrotors, mobile robots, joystick/Iphone, and motion capture system.
* Programmed stable hovering and trajectory tracking of quadrotors with Extended Kalman Filter and sensor fusion.
