<p> 
My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>robotics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. More specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the provably safe collaboration of multiple robots (quadrotors and mobile robots), and safe learning based control techniques for robotics. <br>
