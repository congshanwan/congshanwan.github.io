Research Experience
======
Jan 2015 - present: Graduate Research Assistant, ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Advisors: T. K. Gaylord and M. S. Bakir
  * Project 1: Efficiency Optimization and Angular Misalignment Analysis of Interlayer Grating Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics<br/>
  · Proposed a new simulation method based on the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA-EIS) to accurately calculate the coupling efficiency of interlayer grating couplers with various profiles and analyze the effects of angular misalignments<br/>
  · Demonstrated a grating optimization tool based on Matlab optimization functions and the RCWA-EIS method, which is more computationally efficient than commercial software based on FDTD (Lumerical) or FEM (Comsol) method<br/>
  
  * Project 2: Design and Fabrication of Grating-Assisted-Cylindrical-Resonant-Cavities (GARC) Interlayer Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics<br/>
  · Invented a new type of interlayer optical coupler (GARC) based on cylindrical resonant cavities and circular gratings to achieve efficient and broadband interlayer coupling, which is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 62/557,240<br/>
  · Simulated and optimized the GARC couplers using MEEP FDTD and verified by Lumerical FDTD<br/>
  · Microfabricating the designed GARC coupler using cleanroom facilities, and measuring the interlayer coupling efficiency and the spectral response using a setup consisting of IR tunable laser, polarizer, lock-in amplifier and photodetector<br/>
  
  * Project 3: Design and Fabrication of Self-Aligned Fiber Alignment Fixture for Easier Integration and Assembly<br/>
  · Fabricating a novel multiple-use self-aligned fiber alignment fixture to achieve easy vertical or butt coupling<br/>
  · Aligning the fiber/fiber arrays to the gratings/waveguides and measuring the coupling efficiencies and repeatability<br/>
  
Aug 2013 - Dec 2014: Graduate Research Assistant, MSE, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Advisor: Z. Lin
  * Project: Core-Shell Nanoparticle Synthesis Using Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)<br/>
  · Constructed COMSOL model (FEM) of Au/TiO2 nanoparticles and performed surface plasma resonance analysis<br/>
  · Synthesized block-copolymer chains on star-like micro-initiators as bi-phased and spherical nanoparticle scaffords<br/>

Aug 2010 - May 2013: Undergraduate Research Assistant, MSE, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
