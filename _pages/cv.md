Research Experience
======
Jan 2015 - present: Graduate Research Assistant, ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Advisors: T. K. Gaylord and M. S. Bakir
  * Project 1: Efficiency Optimization and Angular Misalignment Analysis of Interlayer Grating Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics
  · Proposed the rigorous coupled-wave analysis – equivalent index slab (RCWA-EIS) method to accurately calculate the coupling efficiency of interlayer grating couplers with various grating profiles
  · Developed a simulation tool based on the proposed RCWA-EIS method using Matlab to efficiently optimize the interlayer grating coupling efficiency and provide the first angular misalignment analysis
  · Demonstrated a grating optimization tool that is more computationally efficient than commerical softwares based on the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) or the finite element method (FEM)
  
  * Project 2: Design and Fabrication of Grating-Assisted-Cylindrical-Resonant-Cavities (GARC) Interlayer Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics
  · Invented a fundamentally new GARC couplers for interlayer optical coupling based on cylindrical resonant cavities and Bessel-function-defined circular gratings
  · Simulated and optimized the GARC couplers using MEEP FDTD and verified by Lumerical FDTD
  · Currently microfabricating the designed GARC coupler and measuring the interlayer coupling efficiencies and the spectral response
  
  * Project 3: Design and Fabrication of Self-Aligned Fiber Alignment Fixture for Easier Integration and Assembly
  · Designing and fabricating a novel multiple-use self-aligned fiber-to-grating alignment fixture
  · Aligning fiber arrays to the gratings and measuring the fiber-to-grating coupling efficiencies and repeatability
 
 
Aug 2013 - Dec 2014: Graduate Research Assistant, MSE, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Advisor: Z. Lin
  * Project: Core-Shell Nanoparticle Synthesis Using Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)
  · Constructed COMSOL model (FEM) of Au/TiO2 nanoparticles and performed surface plasma resonance analysis
  · Synthesized block-copolymer chains on star-like micro-initiators as nanoparticle scaffords
  · Synthesized bi-phased and spherical NPs with better morphology compared with NPs synthesized by other methods


Aug 2010 - May 2013: Undergraduate Research Assistant, MSE, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
  * Advisor: J. A. Rogers
  * Project: Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SW-CNT) Synthesis and Transistor Fabrication
  · Fabricated FeO catalyst lines by microfabrication techniques and produced CNTs by chemical vapor deposition
  · Increased CNT density by two times and implemented CNTs with semiconducting properties as channels in transistors
  · Tested CNT-based transistors by the probe station and analyzed I-V characteristics


Internship Experience
======

May 2017 - Aug 2017: Research Intern, OFS Fitel LLC
  * Advisor: D. Peckham
  * Project: Dopant Diffusion Modeling and Fiber Testing
  · Developed dopant diffusion models for fiber D2 treatment and reaction-limited process using Matlab
  · Conducted microbending/macrobending test and OTDR test on single-mode fibers and SCUBA fibers
  · Improved fusion splicing recipes for single-mode fibers, submarine SCUBA fibers and terrestrial ULL fibers
  
May 2011 - Aug 2011: Research Intern, Institute of Microelectronics at Chinese Academy of Science
  * Advisor: M. Liu
  * Project: Fabrication and Testing of Resistive-Switching Nonvolatile Memory RRAM  
  · Deposited TaOx thin films by reactive RF magnetron sputtering using a Ta target in oxygen ambient and controlled oxygen profile of TaOx by annealing in oxygen
  · Investigated the oxidation-reduction mechanism of RRAM’s conducting channel and measured channel resistances, I-V curves and set/reset currents
