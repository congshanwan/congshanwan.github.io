Research Experience
======
Jan 2015 - present: Graduate Research Assistant, ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Advisors: T. K. Gaylord and M. S. Bakir
  * Project 1: Efficiency Optimization and Angular Misalignment Analysis of Interlayer Grating Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics<br/>
  · Proposed the rigorous coupled-wave analysis – equivalent index slab (RCWA-EIS) method to accurately calculate the coupling efficiency of interlayer grating couplers with various grating profiles<br/>
  · Developed a simulation tool based on the proposed RCWA-EIS method using Matlab to efficiently optimize the interlayer grating coupling efficiency and provide the first angular misalignment analysis<br/>
  · Demonstrated a grating optimization tool that is more computationally efficient than commercial software based on the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) or the finite element method (FEM)<br/>
  
  * Project 2: Design and Fabrication of Grating-Assisted-Cylindrical-Resonant-Cavities (GARC) Interlayer Couplers for 2.5D/3D Integrated Photonics<br/>
  · Invented a fundamentally new GARC couplers for interlayer optical coupling based on cylindrical resonant cavities and Bessel-function-defined circular gratings<br/>
  · Simulated and optimized the GARC couplers using MEEP FDTD and verified by Lumerical FDTD<br/>
  · Currently microfabricating the designed GARC coupler and measuring the interlayer coupling efficiency and the spectral response<br/>
  
  * Project 3: Design and Fabrication of Self-Aligned Fiber Alignment Fixture for Easier Integration and Assembly<br/>
  · Designing and fabricating a novel multiple-use self-aligned fiber-to-grating alignment fixture<br/>
  · Aligning fiber arrays to the gratings and measuring the fiber-to-grating coupling efficiencies and repeatability<br/>
 
Aug 2013 - Dec 2014: Graduate Research Assistant, MSE, Georgia Institute of Technology
  * Advisor: Z. Lin
  * Project: Core-Shell Nanoparticle Synthesis Using Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)<br/>
  · Constructed COMSOL model (FEM) of Au/TiO2 nanoparticles and performed surface plasma resonance analysis<br/>
  · Synthesized block-copolymer chains on star-like micro-initiators as nanoparticle scaffords<br/>
  · Synthesized bi-phased and spherical NPs with better morphology compared with NPs synthesized by other methods<br/>

Aug 2010 - May 2013: Undergraduate Research Assistant, MSE, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
  * Advisor: J. A. Rogers
  * Project: Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SW-CNT) Synthesis and Transistor Fabrication<br/>
