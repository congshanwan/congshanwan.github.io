I am a Ph.D. candidate in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am coadivsed by Dr. Thomas K. Gaylord and Dr. Muhannad S. Bakir, and my expected graduation time is May 2019. My research interests are optics and photonics. Specifically, I am working on the design, optimization and fabrication of optical couplers for 2.5D/3D integrated photonics. I have a solid background in electromagnetic theory/simulation and in-depth experience on nanofabrication/testing. In the first part of my study, I have developed a simulation tool based on Fourier optics and the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) to optimize interlayer grating couplers used in multilayer platforms and analyze the angular misaglinment effects on the coupling efficiency. The simulation results are verified by FDTD (Lumerical and MEEP) and FEM (COMSOL) softwares. In the second part, I have invented a fundamentally new interlayer coupler, the grating-assisted-cylindrical-resonant-cavites coupler (GARC), based on cylindrical resonant cavities and Bessel-function-defined circular gratings, which has been patterned as an intellectrual property. I am currently fabricating fiber grating couplers and the new GARC couplers as well as designing a self-aligned fiber coupling fixture for easier integration and assembly. I believe I am a good combination of theory and practice.
