Hello! Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests are optics and photonics. Specifically, I am working on the design, optimization and fabrication of optical couplers for 2.5D/3D integrated photonics. I am coadivsed by Dr. Thomas K. Gaylord and Dr. Muhannad S. Bakir, and my expected graduation time is May 2019. Light is such a mysterious and interesting energy form that I am fascinated by it everyday!<br/>
I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Georgia Tech and Univerisity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, respectively. I have learnt the basic physics and chemistry of the building blocks of everything around us, which lays the foundation for my current and future academic pursues. In my undergraduate study, I focused on (opto)electronics materials, which shaped my understanding of active devices indispensable to photonics. In my master study, I had experience on synthesizing novel nanoparticles that exhibit superior light-matter interactions. These knowledges definitely extend my horizon regarding my current photonics research.<br/>
I like painting, reading, and hiking in my part time, and I am an active seeker for anything new!
