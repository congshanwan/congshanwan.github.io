I am a Ph.D. candidate (expected to graduate 2018 May) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.  I am also a member of the [Georgia Robotics and Intelligent Systems (GRITS) Lab](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/2015/10/safety-barrier-certificates-for-multi-robot-system/) supervised by Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/index.html). 

My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>robotics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. More specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the provably safe collaboration of multiple robots (quadrotors and mobile robots), and safe machine learning techniques for robotics.
