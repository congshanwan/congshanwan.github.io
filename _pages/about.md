I am a Ph.D. candidate in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am coadivsed by Dr. Thomas K. Gaylord and Muhannad S. Bakir, and my expected graduation time is May 2019. My research interests are optics and photonics. Specifically, I am working on the design, optimization and fabrication of optical couplers for 2.5D/3D integrated photonics. I have a solid background in electromagnetic theory/simulation and in-depth experience on nanofabrication. In the first part of my study, I have developed a simulation tool based on Fourier optics and the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) to optimize interlayer grating couplers used in multilayer platforms and analyze the angular misaglinment effects on the coupling efficiency. The simulation results are verified by FDTD (Lumerical and MEEP) and FEM (COMSOL) softwares. In the second part, I have invented a fundamentally new interlayer coupler, the grating-assisted-cylindrical-resonant-cavites coupler (GARC), based on cylindrical resonant cavities and circular gratings, which has been patterned as an intellectrual property. I am currently fabricating fiber grating couplers, the new GARC couplers, and designing a self-aligned fiber coupling fixture for easier integration and assembly. I believe I am a good combination of theory and practice. 

%My expected graduation date is May 2019. I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2018 May with a Ph.D. degree in ECE supervised by Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/index.html). My Ph.D. research interests lie in the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>robotics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. More specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the provably safe collaboration of multiple robots (quadrotors and mobile robots), and safe learning based control techniques for robotics.
