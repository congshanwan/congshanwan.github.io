My research interests are optics and photonics. Specifically, I am working on the design, optimization and fabrication of optical couplers for 2.5D/3D integrated photonics. I have a solid background in electromagnetic theory/simulation and an in-depth experience on nanofabrication/testing.<br/> 

The **Theory/Simulation** link summarizes my theoretical work and simulation results; the **Fabrication/Testing** link shows some of my experimental results.<br/>

My top **technical strengths** include:<br/>
* Rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA)
* Finite-difference time-domain simulations (FDTD)
* Finite element method (FEM)
* Beam propagation method (FD-BPM and FFT-BPM)
* Electromagnetic and Optoelectronic theory
* Nanofabrication and testing
