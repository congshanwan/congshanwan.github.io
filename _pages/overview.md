My research interests are optics and photonics. Specifically, I am working on the design, optimization and fabrication of optical couplers for 2.5D/3D integrated photonics. I have a solid background in electromagnetic theory/simulation and an in-depth experience on nanofabrication/testing.<br/> 

The **Theory/Simulation** link summarizes my theoretical work and simulation results; the **Fabrication/Testing** link shows some of my experimental results.<br/>

My **technical strengths** include:<br/>
* Simulation: FDTD (Lumerical, MEEP), FEM (Comsol), RCWA, BPM, PDK, Zemax
* Electromagnetic/optoelectronic theory: Fourier optics, diffractive optics, solid-state physics, imaging theory, holography, spatial light modulators (liquid crystals, MEMS devices)
* Optimization: genetic algorithm, particle swarm, nonconvex optimization
* Fabrication: CMOS fabrication/ Si photonics fabrication
* System integration: flip-chip bonding, 6-deg rotation stage, fiber alignment, laser alignment
* High-speed measurement: TDR, VNA, BERT, OTDR (for optical fiber)
* Programming: Python, Matlab, C
* Cad tools: autocad, solidworks
