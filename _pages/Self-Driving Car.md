Building my T-shaped skills: The vertical bar on the T represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own.

My current and past projects leverage the tools from control theory, robotics, machine learning, quadrotor motion planning and control, multi-robot system, signal filtering and estimation, Robot Operating System (ROS), linear/nonlinear/optimal/networked control. The following is a collection of results and videos for these projects.
